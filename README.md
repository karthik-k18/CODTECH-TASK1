OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT

PROJECT : PASSWORD STRENGTH CHECKER

Program Description
        The password checker program is a simple command-line application that checks the strength of a given password. It evaluates the password based on certain criteria, such as length, character diversity, and presence of special characters, and provides a score indicating the password's strength.

Program Requirements:

  Password Length: The password should be at least 8 characters long.
  Character Diversity: The password should contain a mix of:
  Uppercase letters (A-Z)
  Lowercase letters (a-z)
  Numbers (0-9)
  Special characters (!, @, #, $, etc.)
  
Password Strength Scoring:
  Weak: Password length < 8 or lacks diversity
  Medium: Password length ≥ 8 and has some diversity
  Strong: Password length ≥ 12 and has good diversity
  Very Strong: Password length ≥ 16 and has excellent diversity
Program Flow:

  The user is prompted to enter a password.
  The program checks the password length and character diversity.
  Based on the checks, the program assigns a score to the password.
  The program displays the password strength score and a corresponding message (e.g., "Weak", "Medium", "Strong", or "Very Strong").
